            <h1>Welcome to My AltSchool Journey</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Oluwadunni Rachael, a proud student of AltSchool's School of Engineering, specializing in backend engineering. My AltSchool ID is ALT/SOE/023/3192.</p>
            <p>As someone who is naturally introverted, I've always found a unique solace in the world of technology. My journey into Web3 development began out of curiosity and a desire to be part of the evolving digital landscape. Choosing AltSchool was a step towards fulfilling this dream.</p>
            <p>The reason I joined AltSchool was to harness my potential in backend engineering and to immerse myself in the innovative world of Web3. My goal here is not just to learn and excel academically, but also to build a network with like-minded individuals and to contribute to impactful tech projects.</p>
